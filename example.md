There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:
    
    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

    hey whats up
    im vinnie 


```javascript
#colored code
x = 'hello'
return x
```

Header1 | Second Header
--------|--------------
Content from cell 1 | Content Cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content from 1st column | Content from 2nd column
